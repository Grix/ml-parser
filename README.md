I have tried to reconstruct the original SVN repo as best I could, with git branches for a total of three SVN branches. It is unclear which is the newest version. The scripts were made for old GM versions but should be compatible with new GMS2 also. Maybe now example project or extension files though.

This is the trunk branch, with the following comment in the original readme: 

**Input in rmShowComp**
**[enter] Execute compilation**
**[ctrl] Compile + execute**
**[alt] Interpet**
